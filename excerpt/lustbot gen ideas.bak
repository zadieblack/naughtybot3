Woman masturbates or acts otherwise lewdly... "While the vice principal looked on"
The color of her eyes: "Emerald orbs" 

“His beauty struck my heart, then my loins.
I could not tear my eyes from his manly acorns, nestled in a wiry thatch of dark hair.”

" Every fiber of her being."

" Slow burn of anger."

A soft gasp escaped her lips

" Orbs" for eyes. One book I read used the phrase " sapphire orbs" repeatedly to describe the heroine's eyes. We don't need to be reminded too often what color a character's eyes are. In my early days, I once wrote a hero with emerald eyes. I've learned since then.

Robin Williams once used the phrases " throbbing love machine" and " heat-seeking moisture missile" in reference to the male sex organ in its aroused state.

I've seen " sword" used as a euphemism for erection.

	Hot sleeve of love?"

" Her moist warmth." Think about it.

" Silken warmth." Hmm.

" The heat of her femininity." Well, maybe. At least that doesn't push the giggle button.
