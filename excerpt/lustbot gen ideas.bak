The color of her eyes: "Emerald orbs" 

“His beauty struck my heart, then my loins.
I could not tear my eyes from his manly acorns, nestled in a wiry thatch of dark hair.”

" Every fiber of her being."

" Slow burn of anger."

A soft gasp escaped her lips

" Orbs" for eyes. One book I read used the phrase " sapphire orbs" repeatedly to describe the heroine's eyes. We don't need to be reminded too often what color a character's eyes are. In my early days, I once wrote a hero with emerald eyes. I've learned since then. 

I can't stand breasts being referred to as mounds. Makes me think of a candy bar.  Also globes. Can't stand globes. And I can't stand anyone bucking. I think of a rodeo." 

Arousal as a euphemism for erection. What's wrong with erection? Ditto on mounds for breasts. Don't mention stallion in reference to your hero. Ick.

I once, God help me, called it 'the raging beast of his desire,' but I saved my reputation when I saw the galleys and almost barfed." She also admitted that in her novel Night of the Phantom, she used the phrase " filled her with the hot wet tumult of his love."

 ran across an interesting euphemism for erection: " Love tool."

 The dragon of his desire writhed beneath his tight-stretched trousers.
 
  " Manhood" has been overused, but you'll still run across it. Alone, it's not too bad, but we have to be careful about the adjectives we use with it. " Manroot," on the other hand, is about as purple as it comes.

The phrase " his hardness" makes me think of royalty for some reason. I don't think that was the author's intention.

" Throbbing member?" Well...

" Turgid shaft." Even I'm guilty of that one. Sigh.

" Her gaze traveled down his muscular chest and lean hips to his softly swaying promise of future delight." It doesn't do a thing for me.

Robin Williams once used the phrases " throbbing love machine" and " heat-seeking moisture missile" in reference to the male sex organ in its aroused state.

I've seen " sword" used as a euphemism for erection.

	Hot sleeve of love?"

" Her moist warmth." Think about it.

" Silken warmth." Hmm.

" The heat of her femininity." Well, maybe. At least that doesn't push the giggle button.

" Nest of desire?" Give me a break.

" Perky, pebbled, and plentiful" are often used to describe breasts and nipples. As one reader pointed out, have you ever seen " upturned nipples?" Think gravity, writers. Gravity.

" Nether lips." Not for me.

" Mound of Venus." Yuck. 

" Quivering" and " throbbing" come to mind. I always wondered why she does all the quivering and he does the throbbing. 

“Her weasel-like loins clutching and unclutching his lovely, long, louche manhood, as though squeezing an orange for its juice…

But even as he smiled, he felt the hot fluid between her legs for the first time

Now he opened his clothing and took out his hard, eager sex, and mounting her he let it rest against her thigh as he continued to stroke her and work her.

the nipples of her breasts looked as hard as if they were tiny stones

And as he drove his organ into her, he felt her shudder violently with unwilling pleasure.
