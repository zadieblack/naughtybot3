# Twitter-related functions (Tweepy-based)

# FYI I have learned something about twitter and bot 
# automation that I want to share. I was having a lot 
# of trouble with this bot's replies to people 
# disappearing into the ether. They were being sent. 
# If I logged in as the bot I could see them. But 
# the recipient was not notified and sometimes 
# the replies didnt show up even when I searched for 
# them.
# I googled everything I could think of and finally 
# found a dev who was saying that the name you 
# registered your app with at app.twitter.com had to 
# match your bot's twitter handle. I updated my name 
# to match, and within about 30 minutes the problem 
# was solved! So be sure that the name of your bot 
# matches the twitter handle it will be using.
